  - context: |
      ceph-osd is the object storage daemon for the Ceph distributed file system.
      It is responsible for storing objects on a local file system and providing access to them over the network.
      ceph-volume scans each host in the cluster from time to time in order to determine which devices are present
      and whether they are eligible to be used as OSDs.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the role of OSDs in a Ceph cluster?
        answer: |
          OSDs (Object Storage Daemons) store data, replicate it, and recover from failures,
          forming the backbone of Ceph's distributed storage system.
      - question: how to know the devices in cluster?
        answer: |
          ceph-volume helps to scan host and list out all devices.
      - question: what is the command to list devices available in cluster?
        answer: |
          "ceph orch device ls" command provides list of devices in every node of a cluster.
      - question: how to know whether device is available to become OSD?
        answer: |
          from the command output of "ceph orch device ls", the availability column indicates whether device is
          available or not for OSD.
  - context: |
      In order to deploy an OSD, there must be a storage device that is available on which the OSD will be deployed.
      A storage device is considered available if all of the following conditions are met:
      - The device must have no partitions.
      - The device must not have any LVM state.
      - The device must not be mounted.
      - The device must not contain a file system.
      - The device must not contain a Ceph BlueStore OSD.
      - The device must be larger than 5 GB.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: what determines that device can be used for OSD?
        answer: |
          In order to deploy an OSD, there must be a storage device that is available on which the OSD will be deployed.
          "available" field will be "Yes | No", "Yes" means device is available and "No" is not available.
      - question: If device has already LVM on it, would it be considered for OSD?
        answer: |
          No, The device must not have any LVM state.
      - question: If device has partitions already on it, would it be considered for OSD?
        answer: |
          No, The device must have no partitions.
      - question: If device already mounted and has file system, would it be considered for OSD?
        answer: |
          No, The device must not be mounted and must not contain a file system.
      - question: what is the minimum size for creation of OSD?
        answer: |
          The device must be larger than 5 GB.
  - context: |
        cephadm provides ways to deploy OSD using orchestration commands. there are provisions to deploy OSD on all
        available devices on cluster nodes or particular nodes or on particular devices or also based on particular
        device disk drives and types.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: what is the command to deploy the OSD in cluster?
        answer: |
          "ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices" command helps to create OSD on all devices available on the
          cluster nodes.
      - question: how to deploy OSD on specific host?
        answer: |
          "ceph orch daemon add osd *<host>*:*<device-path>*"" command helps to create OSDs on specific host devices.
      - question: how to deploy OSDs on all devices on a host?
        answer: |
          "ceph orch daemon add osd host1:data_devices=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb,db_devices=/dev/sdc,osds_per_device=2" command
          provides way to deploy OSDs on multiple devices in a host.
      - question: Can OSD be deployed on already created LVM logical volume?
        answer: |
          Yes, "ceph orch daemon add osd *<host>*:*<lvm-path>*" command helps to deploy OSD on LVM path.
      - question: what is ceph orch daemon command?
        answer: |
          ceph orch daemon command helps in management of OSDs in a specific node.
  - context: |
      The effect of ceph orch apply is persistent. This means that drives that are added to the system
      after the ceph orch apply command completes will be automatically found and added to the cluster.
      It also means that drives that become available (by zapping, for example) after the ceph orch apply command
      completes will be automatically found and added to the cluster.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: what is the effect of ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices?
        answer: |
          The command effect will be very persistent, so that every new device been added will be discovered and OSD
          will be deployed on that device.
      - question: Does zapping of OSD removes OSD from device?
        answer: |
          ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices command is very effective, so that if OSD is zapped and it will be added back to
          cluster again as OSD, since device drive becomes available to the cluster.
      - question: How to remove OSD from the device?
        answer: |
          There is a way by changing OSD service configuration to unmanaged by using this command.
          ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices --unmanaged=true
  - context: |
      Service specifications are an abstraction used to tell Ceph which disks it should transform into OSDs and
      which configurations to apply to those OSDs. Service Specifications make it possible to target these disks
      for transformation into OSDs even when the Ceph cluster operator does not know the specific device names
      and paths associated with those disks.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How to deploy OSD service on particulat set of nodes?
        answer: |
          using service specification file, user can deploy OSDs on particular nodes unlike "ceph orch apply osd --all-available-devices"
      - question: what is format of the service specification file?
        answer: |
          a yaml or json format file with defined layout helps to deploy OSDs.
      - question: what is command to deploy OSD using specification file?
        answer: |
          "ceph orch apply -i <spec.yaml>" is used to apply the services defined in the yaml or json format file.
