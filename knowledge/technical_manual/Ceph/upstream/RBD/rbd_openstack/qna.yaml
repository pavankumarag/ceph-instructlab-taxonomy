  - context: |
      Ceph Block Device images can be attached to OpenStack instances via `libvirt`, which uses the QEMU `librbd`
      interface. Ceph stripes block volumes across OSDs, offering better performance than local drives. OpenStack
      integrates with Ceph in three ways: Glance for images, Cinder for volumes, and Nova for guest disks. Booting
      VMs directly in Ceph is recommended for maintenance and live migration efficiency.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How does OpenStack integrate with Ceph Block Devices?
        answer: |
          OpenStack uses Ceph for images (Glance), volumes (Cinder), and guest disks (Nova), enabling direct VM boot.
      - question: |
          Why is it recommended to boot virtual machines directly in Ceph?
        answer: |
          It simplifies maintenance, supports live migration, and ensures seamless recovery with `nova evacuate`.
      - question: |
          What is the role of `libvirt` in using Ceph with OpenStack?
        answer: |
          `libvirt` configures QEMU to interface with `librbd`, allowing efficient attachment of Ceph block devices.
  - context: |
      Ceph pools are used to store block devices for OpenStack services. Separate pools for Glance, Cinder, and Nova
      are recommended. Pools must be initialized using the `rbd pool init` command before use. Placement groups
      should be configured appropriately for optimal performance.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why are separate pools recommended for Glance, Cinder, and Nova?
        answer: |
          To ensure better organization and performance by isolating data for different OpenStack services.
      - question: |
          What command is used to initialize a new Ceph pool for block devices?
        answer: |
          Use `rbd pool init {pool-name}` to initialize the pool.
      - question: |
          Why is configuring placement groups important for Ceph pools?
        answer: |
          Proper placement groups balance data distribution and optimize performance in the Ceph cluster.
  - context: |
      OpenStack nodes interacting with Ceph require the `ceph.conf` file and Ceph client packages. For Glance,
      `python-rbd` is installed. For Nova and Cinder, both `python-rbd` and `ceph-common` are installed. Nodes also
      require appropriate keyring files for authentication.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What Ceph packages are required on the `glance-api` node?
        answer: |
          The `python-rbd` package is needed for `glance-api` to interact with Ceph.
      - question: |
          Which nodes require both `python-rbd` and `ceph-common` packages?
        answer: |
          Nodes running `nova-compute`, `cinder-backup`, and `cinder-volume` require both packages.
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the `ceph.conf` file on OpenStack nodes?
        answer: |
          It provides the configuration details needed for OpenStack services to interact with the Ceph cluster.
  - context: |
      Ceph client authentication in OpenStack uses `cephx`. Unique users are created for Glance, Cinder, and Nova.
      Their keys are stored in keyring files and added to respective nodes. Ownership is set to appropriate OpenStack
      service users like `glance` or `cinder` for secure access.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How is Cephx authentication configured for OpenStack services?
        answer: |
          Unique users are created with `ceph auth get-or-create`, and their keys are distributed to appropriate nodes.
      - question: |
          Why are keyring file ownerships changed for OpenStack service users?
        answer: |
          To ensure that only the specific OpenStack service has secure access to the Ceph authentication keys.
      - question: |
          What command creates a Ceph user for Glance?
        answer: |
          `ceph auth get-or-create client.glance mon 'profile rbd' osd 'profile rbd pool=images' mgr 'profile rbd pool=images'`.
  - context: |
      The `libvirt` process on OpenStack nodes requires the secret key of the Ceph user for Cinder to attach block
      devices. This secret key is stored securely and allows Nova to interact with Ceph during VM operations like
      attaching volumes or booting directly from block devices.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Why does `libvirt` require the secret key of the Ceph user?
        answer: |
          To securely attach Ceph block devices to OpenStack instances managed by Nova.
      - question: |
          What process stores the secret key for `libvirt` on OpenStack nodes?
        answer: |
          The secret key is stored securely as part of the `client.cinder` keyring configuration.
      - question: |
          How does storing the secret key benefit Nova operations?
        answer: |
          It allows Nova to seamlessly attach volumes and boot VMs directly from Ceph block devices.
