      Image live-migration in Ceph enables RBD images to be moved between pools, image formats, and layouts within a
      Ceph cluster, across clusters, or from external data sources. During the process, the source image is deep-copied
      to the destination, including snapshot history, while preserving sparse allocations. By default, for migrations
      within the same cluster, the source image is marked read-only, and clients redirect IOs to the target image.
      The migration can flatten the image to remove dependency on the source's parent or retain sparseness by keeping
      the link to the source's parent. Live-migration can also operate in an import-only mode, where the source remains
      unchanged, and the target can link to external sources like S3 objects or HTTP files.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of live-migration in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Live-migration allows RBD images to move between pools, formats, and layouts within a cluster,
          across clusters or from external data sources while preserving snapshot history and sparse allocation.
      - question: |
          What happens to the source image during live-migration within the same cluster?
        answer: |
          The source image is marked read-only, and all client IOs are redirected to the new target image. Optionally,
          the source's parent link can be preserved or flattened.
      - question: |
          What is import-only mode in live-migration?
        answer: |
          In import-only mode, the source image remains unmodified, and the target image can link to external data
          sources such as S3 objects, HTTP files, or NBD exports.
  - context: |
      Live-migration consists of three main steps:
      1. **Prepare Migration:** Creates a target image linked to the source. The source is marked read-only unless in
         import-only mode. Reads to uninitialized extents in the target redirect to the source, and writes deep-copy
         the data from the source.
      2. **Execute Migration:** Background operation that deep-copies all initialized blocks from the source to the
         target. This step can run while clients use the target.
      3. **Finish Migration:** Finalizes migration by either committing or aborting. Committing removes cross-links
         and optionally deletes the source image. Aborting removes the target image.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the three steps of live-migration?
        answer: |
          1. **Prepare Migration:** Creates and links the target to the source.
          2. **Execute Migration:** Deep-copies initialized blocks to the target.
          3. **Finish Migration:** Commits or aborts the migration process.
      - question: |
          What happens during the "Prepare Migration" step?
        answer: |
          The target image is created and linked to the source. Reads to uninitialized extents redirect to the source,
          and writes deep-copy data from the source. The source is marked read-only unless in import-only mode.
      - question: |
          Can clients use the target image during the "Execute Migration" step?
        answer: |
          Yes, clients can actively use the target image while the deep-copy operation runs in the background.
  - context: |
      The live-migration process is initiated using the `rbd migration prepare` command, which accepts layout options
      similar to the `rbd create` command. Clients using the source image must be stopped before preparing migration,
      as the prepare step fails if clients have the source image open in read/write mode. After preparation, the source
      image moves to the RBD trash, and clients can restart using the target image. The migration status can be checked
      with `rbd status`, showing the source, destination, and migration state.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How is live-migration initiated in Ceph?
        answer: |
          Live-migration is initiated using the `rbd migration prepare` command, which creates and links the target
          image to the source image, marking the source read-only.
      - question: |
          Why must clients stop using the source image before preparing migration?
        answer: |
          The prepare step fails if the source image is open in read/write mode. Stopping clients ensures the source
          image can be marked read-only for migration.
      - question: |
          How can the migration status be checked?
        answer: |
          The migration status can be checked with the `rbd status` command, which shows the source, destination,
          and current migration state.
  - context: |
      Live-migration requires the Ceph Nautilus release or later. Support for external data sources, such as S3 objects
      or HTTP files, requires the Ceph Pacific release. The `krbd` kernel module does not currently
      support live-migration.
      There is also a temporary requirement to stop using the source image before preparing migration, except in
      import-only mode, to ensure that clients update to use the target image.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Which Ceph release introduced live-migration?
        answer: |
          Live-migration was introduced in the Ceph Nautilus release.
      - question: |
          What is required to support external data sources in live-migration?
        answer: |
          Support for external data sources, such as S3 objects or HTTP files, requires the Ceph Pacific release.
      - question: |
          Does the `krbd` kernel module support live-migration?
        answer: |
          No, the `krbd` kernel module does not currently support live-migration.
  - context: |
      During live-migration, the source image moves to the RBD trash to prevent unintended usage.
      If migration is aborted,the target image is removed.
      If committed, the source is deleted unless in import-only mode.
      Errors during migration can be addressed by manually aborting or restarting the process.
      It is important to monitor migration progress
      using `rbd status` and resolve issues like insufficient permissions
      or storage space to avoid failures.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What happens to the source image during live-migration?
        answer: |
          The source image moves to the RBD trash to avoid unintended usage during migration. It is deleted upon
          committing the migration unless in import-only mode.
      - question: |
          How are errors during live-migration handled?
        answer: |
          Errors can be addressed by aborting or restarting the process. It is essential to monitor progress and resolve
          issues like permissions or storage space problems.
      - question: |
          What happens if the migration is aborted?
        answer: |
          If the migration is aborted, the target image is removed, and the source image is unlinked from the target.
