      Ceph RBD supports snapshots and clones to efficiently provision block devices to virtual machines. A "golden"
      image can be configured with an operating system and software, followed by creating a snapshot of this image.
      Clones can then be made from the snapshot using a copy-on-write mechanism, allowing fast provisioning without
      downloading the entire image for each virtual machine.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of snapshots and clones in Ceph RBD?
        answer: |
          Snapshots and clones enable fast provisioning of virtual machine block devices by leveraging copy-on-write
          mechanics.
      - question: |
          What is a "golden" image in Ceph RBD?
        answer: |
          A "golden" image is a pre-configured block device with an OS and software, used as a template for snapshots
          and clones.
      - question: |
          How do snapshots improve provisioning efficiency?
        answer: |
          Snapshots allow creating clones without copying the entire image, speeding up virtual machine deployment.
  - context: |
      QEMU integrates with Ceph RBD to attach block device images directly as virtual block devices using `librbd`.
      This avoids mapping images on the host and enhances performance. QEMU allows specifying options like pool name,
      image name, and snapshots, and supports converting virtual machine images to Ceph RBD format.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How does QEMU improve performance when used with Ceph RBD?
        answer: |
          By directly attaching images via `librbd`, it avoids context switches and utilizes RBD caching.
      - question: |
          What is the command format for specifying an RBD image in QEMU?
        answer: |
          `qemu-img {command} [options] rbd:{pool-name}/{image-name}[@snapshot-name][:options...]`.
      - question: |
          Can QEMU convert images to Ceph RBD format?
        answer: |
          Yes, QEMU can convert formats like qcow2 to RBD using the `qemu-img convert` command.
  - context: |
      Using QEMU, RBD block device images can be created by specifying the pool name, image name, and size. Similarly,
      resizing an image involves specifying the pool, image, and new size. The `raw` data format is recommended for
      compatibility and performance.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do you create a Ceph RBD image with QEMU?
        answer: |
          Use `qemu-img create -f raw rbd:{pool-name}/{image-name} {size}`.
      - question: |
          What is the recommended format for RBD images with QEMU?
        answer: |
          The `raw` format is recommended for optimal performance and compatibility.
      - question: |
          How can an RBD image be resized with QEMU?
        answer: |
          Use `qemu-img resize rbd:{pool-name}/{image-name} {size}` to change the image size.
  - context: |
      QEMU enables users to retrieve detailed information about RBD images, such as pool name, image name, and snapshot
      details. The `qemu-img info` command provides insights into image attributes like size, format, and backing file.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can you retrieve RBD image details using QEMU?
        answer: |
          Use `qemu-img info rbd:{pool-name}/{image-name}` to get detailed image information.
      - question: |
          What kind of details does `qemu-img info` provide?
        answer: |
          It provides image attributes like size, format, and backing file information.
      - question: |
          Why is retrieving image information important in QEMU?
        answer: |
          To verify configuration, ensure compatibility, and debug issues with virtual machines.
  - context: |
      RBD caching in QEMU enhances performance by controlling `librbd` caching options. Setting `rbd_cache=true` with
      `cache=writeback` ensures safe and efficient write operations. Misconfiguration risks data loss, especially
      during unclean QEMU exits.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How does RBD caching improve performance in QEMU?
        answer: |
          By optimizing write operations and reducing latency through controlled caching mechanisms.
      - question: |
          What cache options should be set with `rbd_cache=true`?
        answer: |
          `cache=writeback` must be set to ensure safe write operations and avoid data loss.
      - question: |
          What happens if `cache=writeback` is not set with `rbd_cache=true`?
        answer: |
          It risks data loss, as QEMU might not send flush requests to `librbd`.
